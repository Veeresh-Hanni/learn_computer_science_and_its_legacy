# Circular Linked List in Python

This document provides a **simple, clean, and well-commented implementation** of a Circular Linked List in Python. It also includes **descriptive explanations and notes** for each operation to help understand how the data structure works.

---

## What is a Circular Linked List?
A **circular linked list** is a linear data structure where each node points to the **next node**, and the last node points back to the **first node**, forming a circle.

There are two types:
- **Singly Circular Linked List**: Only `next` pointers are used.
- **Doubly Circular Linked List**: Both `prev` and `next` pointers are used.

In this implementation, we'll focus on **Singly Circular Linked List**.

## Node Structure
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data        # Data of the node
        self.next = None        # Pointer to the next node (circular reference later)
```

---

## CircularLinkedList Class
This class maintains a `tail` pointer (last node), which makes insertion and traversal easier.
```python
class CircularLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tail = None        # Tail points to the last node in the list
```

## Time Complexity Comparison
| Operation              | Singly Linked List | Doubly Linked List | Circular Linked List |
|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Insert at Beginning    | O(1)               | O(1)               | O(1)                  |
| Insert at End          | O(n)               | O(n)               | O(1) (with tail)      |
| Insert at Position     | O(n)               | O(n)               | O(n)                  |
| Delete at Beginning    | O(1)               | O(1)               | O(1)                  |
| Delete at End          | O(n)               | O(n)               | O(n)                  |
| Delete at Position     | O(n)               | O(n)               | O(n)                  |
| Search                 | O(n)               | O(n)               | O(n)                  |
| Update at Position     | O(n)               | O(n)               | O(n)                  |
| Length                 | O(n)               | O(n)               | O(n)                  |

**Note:**
- Circular linked lists allow looping through the list without checking for `None`, but care must be taken to avoid infinite loops.
- Insertion at end is efficient if we maintain a tail pointer.

## Detailed Operation Explanations and Use Cases

### 1. Insert at Beginning
**How it works:** A new node is inserted right after the tail node. This makes the new node the effective head of the list.
**Use case:** Useful in round-robin scheduling where a new task is added with high priority.

### 2. Insert at End
**How it works:** A new node is added after the tail, and the tail pointer is updated to point to the new node.
**Use case:** Used in streaming systems where new data keeps coming at the end of the stream.

### 3. Delete at Beginning
**How it works:** The node after the tail (i.e., the head) is removed, and tail's next pointer is updated.
**Use case:** Removing a completed job in a cyclic task manager.

### 4. Delete at End
**How it works:** Requires traversal to the node before the tail. Once found, it becomes the new tail.
**Use case:** Used when the oldest task in a queue must be discarded.

### 5. Display List
**How it works:** Starts from the head (tail.next) and loops until it comes back to the same node.
**Use case:** Viewing all participants in a game rotation or network ring.

### 6. Length
**How it works:** Loops through the list counting each node.
**Use case:** Checking how many processes are running in a circular scheduler.

### 7. Search
**How it works:** Traverse from head to tail checking each nodeâ€™s data.
**Use case:** Verifying if a particular user is still in a conference call loop.

## Real-World Applications
- **CPU Scheduling**: Circular linked lists are used in round-robin scheduling algorithms.
- **Multiplayer Games**: Managing players' turns in a circle.
- **Network Topology**: Token ring networks use circular structure.
- **Music Playlist Loops**: Where the end links back to the beginning for continuous play.
- **Circular Buffers**: Implementing buffers that wrap around (like audio/video streaming buffers).

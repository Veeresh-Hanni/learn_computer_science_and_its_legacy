## 📖 About This Repository

This project is a **learning journey** into the evolution of **Computer Science and Programming** — from the earliest days of computing to modern development practices.

We explore **how coding evolved**, **why different languages exist**, and **how computing shaped the world**.

---

## 🚀 How Coding Evolved

Coding has come a long way — from **punch cards** and **assembly language** to today’s **AI-driven development**.

This repository covers:

- **The early days of programming** – Machine & Assembly languages
- **The rise of high-level languages** – C, Java, Python & beyond
- **Modern development practices** – AI, automation, open-source collaboration

## 🖥️ Compiled vs Interpreted Languages

Programming languages work differently based on how they execute code.

### **Compiled Languages** (e.g., Java, C, C++)

- Code is **translated into machine code** before running.
- **Pros:** Faster execution, optimized performance.
- **Cons:** Requires compilation step.

### **Interpreted Languages** (e.g., Python, JavaScript)

- Code is **executed line-by-line** by an interpreter.
- **Pros:** Easier to debug, quicker to write & test.
- **Cons:** Slower than compiled code.

**Real-world analogy:**

- **Compiled:** Like baking a cake (prepare fully before serving).
- **Interpreted:** Like cooking live on a pan (execute step-by-step).
